It has been quite some time, but I'm back and writing like I never stopped! I'm ready to share my journey, its been a long one thus far. Since my last posts, I've come so far, I've hunkered down and really set my mind to expanding my knowledge. I was heavily focused on one language GoLang and have since taken a leap towards Python. Follow on, this has been fun for me, I hope for any new comers wishing to gain some insight on how to progress quickly that my journey may impact yours, enjoy!

## The Path
The path has varied along the way, but none the less, I've found the path. I was initially working on many of my projects and focusing on my main language as GoLang. This felt a bit out of place for me, but none the less I stuck to it and learned the language, I still love GoLang and always will. But since, I've switched to Python, this has been the best thing to happen to me in all my tech experiences. Python was my path, and for any beginners I highly recommend it be yours as well.

## My Progressions
After switching to Python, I really focused, I stuck to completing all my ideas and projects in Python. This was an amazing experience for me, over all my years trying to learn how to write code properly. I never found a language that really satisfied my ability to read, understand and grasp the concepts and apply them accordingly. Python to me, was designed for this, the term "pythonic", the readability of the code. It all adds up and for me it is the best language for beginners.

## A Little Proof
The proof is in the pudding I suppose, since I made the switch here are some projects I've completed or worked on. My advice, stay dedicated, problem solve vigorously and become a python developer in no time!
