Well, the title says it all, the great FTP rant. This rant, strangely enough, led me to set up a darknet router. A friend of mine, we'll call him `anon`, he went on a rant after I made a comment about him still using FTP. After this, he and I had a private discussion. This discussion, along with the rant, convinced me to set up a darknet router and start treating anonymity and privacy with a bit more respect again.
## The Rant
```
@anon  I share my images with ftp.
@anon  :>
@anon  not only to make wired cringe, but because I support reverse discrimination against HTTP.
@anon  HTTP privilege is bullshit.
@anon  always have ports 80 and 443 open.
@anon  but anything else gets your packets dropped.
@anon  if more people supported the other protocols we could get the walls taken down!
@anon  WHO IS WITH ME!?!?
@anon     _.-._     
@anon    |_| | |-.  
@anon   /  '-| | |\ 
@anon  (   ___)'-' |
@anon   \   \     / 
@anon    \       /  
@anon     |     |   
@anon  Have you seen the kind of insensitive things people have HTTP do?
@anon  They have stupid shit like, doing DNS lookups. OVER HTTP.
@anon  and a time synchronization system. OVER HTTP.
@anon  and transferring binaries over HTTP instead of a protocol that was actually made to do it
@anon  and MY GOD, they do EMAIL over HTTP.
@anon  email had been around for how many fucking years before anyone even thought of HTTP?!?
@anon  and you know what else?
@anon  they do chat over HTTP.
@anon  I know, the horror.
@anon  Look around you. This is one of the last bastions of free protocols.
@anon  This stuff that goes over HTTP isn't free.
@anon  HTTP is, but they've used word tricks to get you to not care that they're making new protocols.
@anon  by calling them something else.
@anon  They call them "API"s
@anon  and if you're "lucky" they'll tell you how to scratch their ass just the right way to get them to give you information you think you need.
@anon  until the API goes from version 54 to version 55.
@anon  without warning.
@anon  without repurcussions if shit breaks.
@anon  because you agreed to it in their EULA, Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, or whatever.
@anon  speaking of which
@anon  when you agreed to their terms, which you didn't read, by using their service, you also agreed to give up your information.
@anon  anything that passes through their systems.
@anon  legally theirs.
@anon  to do with whatever the fuck they want.
@anon  extrapolate.
@anon  sell.
@anon  merge.
@anon  sort.
@anon  resell.
@anon  but yeah, complain about me using an ftp link.
```
After I saw this he and I had a private discussion, this eventually led me to set up the darknet router. For several days I also toyed around with old protocols I no longer use anymore. FTP being one of them, and I must say, I have no use for it.

Utilizing encryption and proxy chains are definitely something I needed to use more. So, I decided to set up a few services on the darknet, also anonet. Most people, assume darknet = illegal, however, that is not the case here, I am simply using and managing technologies that Iâ€™m introduced to.

This is why I love technology, ever-evolving, vast world of knowledge to explore until my days are no more. Over the next few weeks, I will be blogging guides and thoughts pertaining to such. This is not only for public sake but for my own personal gain. I find when I write about my projects the data is retained on a higher level.
